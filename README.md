**COVID-19 Data Analysis Project**


**Project Overview**
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic using Python and Tableau. The project aims to provide key insights into the spread, impact, and trends of the virus through data visualization and analysis. Python is utilized for data processing and analysis, while Tableau is used to create interactive dashboards and visualizations that effectively communicate the findings.


**Features**

Data Processing: Clean and preprocess COVID-19 datasets using Python.

Data Visualization: Create insightful visualizations using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, and develop interactive dashboards in Tableau.

Key Insights: Analyze the spread of COVID-19, mortality and recovery rates, and the impact on different regions and demographics.

Jupyter Notebook: Document the analysis process and results in an interactive environment.



The datasets used in this project include global COVID-19 data, such as:


Confirmed Cases: Number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.

Deaths: Number of deaths attributed to COVID-19.

Recovered: Number of recovered cases.

Date: The date on which the data was recorded.

Country/Region: Geographical location of the data.




The project explores various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including:



Mortality and Recovery Rates: Analysis of mortality and recovery rates by region and over time.

Impact Assessment: Assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare systems and economies.



**Technologies Used**
Python: Core programming language for data analysis.

Libraries:

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
